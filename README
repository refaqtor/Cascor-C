# Cascor
Code from the 90s for the Cascade-Correlation algorithm developed by Scott Fahlman and Christian Lebiere. This is a work-in-progress to update the code to work with modern machines.

compile is a script to compile everything as-is and copy the executable to bin/cascade


Changes that I've made:

-fixed double free errors in recurrent option
-fixed free error for non-string inputs
-restructured code so that each line is < 80 characters
-changed make files to compile locally, rather into the system


Bugs that are identified and have yet to be tackled:

-after the addition of some units, all outputs become nan after repeated trains.
-Varsigmoid isn't parsed for when you're switching unit types
