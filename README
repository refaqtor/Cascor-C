# Cascor
Code from the 90s for the Cascade-Correlation algorithm developed by Scott Fahlman and Christian Lebiere. This is a work-in-progress to update the code to work with modern machines.

compile is a script to compile everything as-is and copy the executable to bin/cascade


Changes that I've made:

-fixed double free errors in recurrent option
-fixed free error for non-string inputs
-restructured code so that each line is < 80 characters
-changed make files to compile locally, rather into the system
-removed misleading option for type "varsigmoid" that did not exist
    (Actually apparently this exists??? I removed the prompt because I could not find an option for it; I may go back on it)
-fixed potential buffer overflow from input by limiting length of inputs


Bugs that are identified and have yet to be tackled:

-after the addition of some units, all outputs become nan after repeated trains.
-if you do train <net_name> two-spirals.data for any net_name, on the 2nd run it becomes all NaNs (for the first net to be trained twice with two-spirals.data)
-segfault occurs after training a net on two-spirals.data until NaN appears, testing it, and running a train.

Progress:

cNet->outputTypes[i] is "uninitialized" on second run onwards. I believe this is because the author meant to use global variable cNet instead of net for several functions. Unconfirmed.
