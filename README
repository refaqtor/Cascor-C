# Cascor
Code from the 90s for the Cascade-Correlation algorithm developed by Scott Fahlman and Christian Lebiere. This is a work-in-progress to update the code to work with modern machines.

compile is a script to compile everything as-is and copy the executable to bin/cascade


Changes that I've made:

-fixed double free errors in recurrent option
-fixed free error for non-string inputs
-restructured code so that each line is < 80 characters
-changed make files to compile locally, rather into the system
-removed misleading option for type "varsigmoid" that did not exist

Bugs that are identified and have yet to be tackled:

-after the addition of some units, all outputs become nan after repeated trains.
-if you do train t two-spirals.data, on the 2nd run it becomes all NaNs???
-segfault occurs after training a net on two-spirals.data until NaN appears, testing it, and running a train.

Progress:

cNet->outputTypes[i] is "uninitialized" on second run onwards. I believe this is because the author meant to use global variable cNet instead of net for several functions. Unconfirmed.
